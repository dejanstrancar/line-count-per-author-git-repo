## Count number of changes per author in git repository

### Using

Move file to repo locally.
Give him exec permissions by 

```bash
chmod +x line-count-per-author-git-repo.sh
```

If repo is big it will take a while, but you will be notified when script is done.
The output is provided in author_changes_summary.txt in same directory as script is.
